# dsc-Deloitte-072423📉📊📈 - Neural Networks: Network Regularization 🧠⚡️

This repository contains material describing concepts of neural network modeling and how to apply regularization techniques within them. Recall that regularization refers to techniques applied to models that regulate the coefficients in a model (in effect a kind of feature selection). In the case of linear regression, regularization took two forms: L1 and L2 AKA Ridge and Lasso regressions. These techniques added a penalty term to the model equation to either diminish or completely remove the coefficients of unimportant columns therefor rooting out coefficients which don't add value to the model but limiting their importance in the model.
